Graduate Student Assistant at Eastern Washington University 🎓. I spend most of my free time getting outdoors or failing (spectacularly) at ⚔️ Hack The Box ⚔️. Born and raised in Washington State, I love everything it has to offer year-round.

Outside of HTB, I enjoy random CTFs and competitions. Having grown up on competitive gaming, finding a new outlet for that drive has been both fun and rewarding, pushing me to explore different areas of computer science while meeting and working with some truly amazing people along the way.
