## Challenge Description 

Challenge prompt: 
`As the CEO of a company, I made a quite unique notes app. Check it out!`

Author: 
`ahh`

This challenge provided two different webpages one which was a note taking application that users could make an account for in order to generate notes, the second page is a bot page which will connect to the given URL when asked too. We were also provided the back end code which revealed the cookie `flag` being added to the bot when connecting to a given endpoint.

## Solution 

### Discovery of XSS

The first thing I decided to test on the application was the possibility of XSS attacks in the notes themselves which revealed the page was vulnerable to. In order to test XSS quickly I simply used a `<script>alert("Hello, World")</script>`. This was proof that XSS was a active attack vector

### Python Web server setup 

Before creating a script in order to steal the cookies of the connected admin bot I was required to configure port forwarding on a chosen port which for this challenge `54444` on my local gateway. Then using a python web server I was able to run the command `python3 -m http.server 54444` which allowed for http requests to port `54444` and would print any requests made to the server.

### XSS payload 

With the server setup to receive requests I was able to craft a simple JavaScript script which would send a get request to my web server with the flag attached to the bot as a endpoint on the server in the form `http://<ip>:<port>/<flag>` which revealed the flag, from there I simply copied the endpoint to a URL decoder which revealed the flag in its correct format as shown in the screenshot below.
